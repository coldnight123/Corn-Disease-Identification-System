### Project Introduction

Developed to counter the negative impacts of corn leaf diseases on agricultural yield and quality, this research conducts an in-depth analysis of the critical importance and vast application prospects of corn disease identification within the field of agricultural science. In the YOLOv5 model designing and investigating process, this paper compares two introduced attention mechanisms, ultimately selecting the most appropriate type and method. Utilizing deep learning technology and training on the Kaggle platform, the system uses a MySQL database for data management, with a B/S architecture. The Vue framework is used for the frontend, with the Gin framework serving backend interfaces. Moreover, system communication between Go and Python is facilitated using gRPC technology, along with the YOLOv5 model for efficient target detection, all contributing to the development of a high-precision corn disease identification system.
